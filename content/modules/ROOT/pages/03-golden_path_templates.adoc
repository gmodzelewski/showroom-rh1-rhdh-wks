== A Day in the Life of a Developer with RHDH

In the first section of this workshop, we explained some common challenges that developers face: navigating through disorganized systems and dealing with incomplete or outdated documentation. Now, let's explore how the Red Hat Developer Hub can transform that frustrating experience into a positive one. 

=== Golden Path Templates

One of the primary use cases for Red Hat Developer Hub is to streamline the onboarding of new team members and promote golden paths, offering a guided approach to building components in a self-service manner. The templating engine in RHDH, called Scaffolder, enables the execution of golden path templates that initialize repositories with skeleton code and predefined settings.  A software template is defined in a YAML file, specifying the parameters and steps to execute.

Within each step, built-in actions are leveraged to perform various tasks. These actions handle the heavy lifting for you, such as creating a workspace, generating application skeletons, pushing to GitHub, or even triggering your CI/CD pipeline. 

When the Scaffolder parses the template, it generates input forms in its UI based on the specified parameters, and then proceeds to execute the steps outlined in the template. This seamless process helps developers create new components with ease and ensures adherence to best practices within the organization.

=== Launching your first Golden Path Template (GPT)

As a new developer, you are asked to join a project and implement a modification to a feature within a Quarkus-based service. To do that you are going to use a pre-configured Golden Path Template, which is going to streamline your onboarding process to your new project and perform the following in a self service manner:

. The GPT is going to create two repositories in Gitlab, one for the application source code and the other for ArgoCD Manifests.
. The next step in the GPT will instruct ArgoCD to create an application and all the specified resources in the Manifests in the target OpenShift cluster.
. In this example we are using Helm charts as an input to ArgoCD to deploy:
    .. A CI pipeline in Tekton to build your application and a webhook event listener that is triggered on every commit to the source code repository.
    .. All the Kubernetes resources needed to deploy the *my-quarkus-app*, including a Deployment, Service and Route.

TIP: Feel free tp explore both repositories by accessing the link:https://gitlab-gitlab.apps.cluster-677l9.sandbox2418.opentlc.com/development/my-quarkus-app[Source Code Repo] and the link:https://gitlab-gitlab.apps.cluster-677l9.sandbox2418.opentlc.com/development/my-quarkus-app-gitops[GitOps Manifests Repo]

To launch the Golden Path Template, click on *Create* in the sidebar menu. You will be presented with all the Golden Path Templates that the Platform Engineering team configured for you. Right now we have only one template, but we could have as many as we need. Click the *Choose* link on the bottom right of the “Securing a Quarkus Service Software Supply Chain“ tile to select this template.  

image::Choose_GPT.png[]

Next, you'll be prompted to fill out a straightforward form with basic information. Unlike a classic ticket system, this wizard-style interface is intuitive and tailored specifically for this project, ensuring a quick and straightforward process. At a later step in the workshop you'll discover the ease and flexibility of designing similar forms with the RHDH Templating Engine. Keep the default values in the first form and click *NEXT STEP* to proceed.

image::GPT_form_1.png[]

In the second form, choose *Quay* from the *Image Registry* dropdown. 

image::GPT_form_2.png[]

This action automatically populates relevant default values, including the Quay server host, the organization for your container image repositories, and the tag for your base image. Keep the default values and click *NEXT STEP* to proceed.

image::GPT_form2_update.png[]

In the third and final form, you'll see pre-filled default values for the Git server hosting your application's source code repository, the repository containing the GitOps manifests, and the GitLab group for these repositories. Again keep the default values and click *NEXT STEP* to proceed.

image::GPT_form_3.png[]

You will be presented with a summary. You can now review that everything is in order then click the *Create* button.

image::GPT_Summary.png[]

After clicking the *Create* button, Red Hat Developer Hub will utilize the information you've provided to initiate the setup process as outlined in the selected Golden Path Template. It will also register your application in the *Catalog*. Now, proceed by clicking the *Open Component in catalog* link.

=== Exploring the RHDH Dashboard

On clicking the *Open Component in catalog*,  the *RHDH Dashboard* will launch in a new tab. Here you have everything you need to work on your task and implement that new feature in the Quarkus application. Let’s take a moment to explore the different tabs available starting with the *Overview* tab.

==== Overview tab

The *Overview* tab displays a few tiles sucah as:

. The *Links* tile: Gives you access to your Cloud Developmenet Environment link:https://developers.redhat.com/products/openshift-dev-spaces/overview[Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces]. You can choose your preferred IDE, either Microsoft Visual Studio Code or JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA. 
. The *Merge request statistics* tile offers insights into your GitLab merge requests.
. The *About* tile: Allows direct access to your application's source code that was just created for you in *GitLab* via the *View Source* link and to the application documentation through the *View TechDocs* link.
. The *ArgoCD overview* tile displays the current status of your application in *ArgoCD* (This may take a few minutes to sync and display the application status.).


Let’s start by creating the workspace for your application by clicking on the *OpenShift Dev Spaces (VScode)* link.



image::RHDH_Dashboard.png[]

This will launch the login process in a new tab. To login into *OpenShift Dev Spaces*,follow these step:

. Choose to *login with OpenShift*
+
. Select *login with rhsso*
+
. Then enter your OpenShift credentials
+
. Authorize *OpenShift Dev Spaces* to access your account by clicking the *Allow selected permissions* button.
+
. You'll then be prompted to sign into *GitLab*. Click the *Sign in* button to proceed.
+
. Finally, authorize *OpenShift Dev Spaces* to use your *GitLab* account by clicking the *Authorize* button. 

Once logged in, *OpenShift Dev Spaces* will automatically locate the *Devfile* in your *GitLab* repository and begin processing it to create your workspace.

While *OpenShift Dev Spaces* is setting up your workspace, let's take this opportunity to further explore the *RHDH Dashboard*. Return to the *Overview* tab in your browser and select the *View TechDocs* link in the *About* tile.

NOTE: You can also access the Documentation from by selecting Docs from the upper menu.

image::TechDocs_Link.png[]

'''

==== Docs tab

Here you can see the technical documentation for the *my-quarkus-app* component. RHDH follows a “doc-like-code” approach as explained in the previous section. The documentation is written in Markdown format and hosted in the same Git repository as the component source code. The Docs tab displays the documentation in HTML format, which has been generated and published as part of the execution of our Golden Path Template.

You can also open any documentation related issue directly from the *Docs* tab. For example, we are not impressed by the level of detail provided in this document. Let's flag this for the team's attention.


image::View_TechDocs.png[]

To do so, highlight the text 'A cool Quarkus app.' A small popup will appear with the option *Open GitLab Issue.*

image::Create_Issue.png[]

This will open a new tab in your browser to allow you to creeate an issue in Gitlab. When creating the issue, you can replace the text ‘replace this line with your comment’ with the following feedback: 'The current details are quite sparse, please enrich the documentation.’. Then click the *Create issue* button.

image::Provide_Issue_Details.png[]

Switch back to the *my-quarkus-app Dashboard* tab in your browser. Then navigate to the *Issues* tab by selecting it from the upper menu. The issue you've raised is now visible and can be tracked by all developers collaborating on the project. 

image::Issues_View.png[]


It's time to examine how RHDH has modeled our application in the Software Catalog. Look for the *Dependencies* option in the top menu. If *Dependencies* isn't immediately visible, use the navigation arrows to scroll left through the menu options until you find it.

image::Dependencies_Tab.png[]


'''

==== Dependencies tab

The *Dependencies* view allows you to inspect your application’s relationships and dependencies as we explained in the previous section.

image::Dependencis_View.png[]

In this example we can quickly understand that we have a component called *my-quarkus-app* that provides an API with the same name and is owned by the group named *user1*.

image::My-quarkus-app-diagram.png[]

Now let’s explore the *my-quarkus-app* API by clicking on it in the relationship diagram.

'''

==== API tab

In the API view, you'll find a lot of helpful information including access to source code, documentation, and a visual representation of relationships from the API's perspective.  To interact with your API, select the *Definition* tab. 

image::API_View.png[]

Here you'll find a Swagger UI, which provides an interactive interface for exploring and testing your API's requests.

image::Swagger_UI.png[]

Switch back to the “Overview” tab, and under owner click on the link corresponding to your user, which in our example is labeled as *user1*.

image::Switch_To_Owner_View.png[]

'''

==== Ownership tab

As we discussed in the workshop introduction, it is often very hard to understand who owns which component. However, RHDH simplifies this by clearly displaying the group responsible for the component and APIs you're working with, complete with contact details. You can also view all related components and APIs managed by this group.
So really the Red Hat Developer Hub makes it very easy to find and explore every aspect of your application from within the comfort of your RHDH dashboard.

Now, let's navigate back to our application component. Click on the link labeled *1 SERVICE Component* to return to the *RHDH Software Catalog*.

image::Ownership_view.png[]

Select the *my-quarkus-app* component from the list to navigate back to your *Dashboard*.

image::Catalog_View_From_Ownership_Link.png[]

'''

==== Topology tab

Select the *Topology* tab from the upper menu. This view, powered by an RHDH Plugin, brings the familiar *OpenShift Topology* view experience into the *Red Hat Developer Hub*, allowing you to visualize the workloads within your Kubernetes namespace.

Immediately, you'll notice a red ring around your *Pod*, indicating a startup issue. Hover over the Pod to reveal an *ErrImagePull* error. When you click on the Pod, a side pane
slides in from the right to show more details. Switch to the *Resources* tab, the error message makes it clear that the application Pod failed to start due to a missing image. To confirm this, let's proceed to the *Image Registry* view by selecting it from the upper menu.

image::Topology_View.png[]

'''

==== Image Registry tab

Under the hood we are using a plugin to enrich the Image Registry view with insights from a Quay hosted registry. As we anticipated, the Image Registry is currently empty. To address this, let's switch back to the browser tab where you logged-in Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces.

image::Image_Registry_Tab.png[]

'''

==== Implementing a code change in OpenShift Dev Spaces

Your IDE should now be loaded and ready in a browser tab. Click on the *Yes, I Trust the Authors* button to proceed.

image::Dev_Spaces_Trust_Authors.png[]

To accomplish your task, you are going to do three things:

. Update the hello method in the ExampleResource.java class.
. Update the JUnit test that verifies the output from this method.
. Update the documentation to reflect your change.

In your *my-quarkus-app* workspace, expand the folders *src -> main -> java*, and then open the file *ExampleResource.java*. On line 14, replace the return message of the hello method from "Hello RESTEasy" to “Hello from RHDH”.

image::Modify_ExampleResource.png[]

Next, update the JUnit test for this method. Expand the folders *src -> main -> test*, and open the file *ExampleResourceTest.java*. On line 18, change the expected text from "Hello RESTEasy" to “Hello from RHDH”.

image::Modify_ExampleResourceTest.png[]

Finally, let's update the Documentation with our latest changes. Expand the *docs* folder and open the file *Index.md*. At the end of the document, add the following text: "Release 1.0: Update to ExampleResource.hello() method to return 'Hello from RHDH'." Now, click on the *Source Control* icon in the left menu.

image::Index_File.png[]

Enter the commit message “My First Commit” and then click on the *Commit* button. In the pop-up window that follows, click *Yes* to stage your changes. Finally, click on the *Sync Changes* button and in the pop-up the follows clikc *OK* to oush your changes and complete the process. You have now successfully implemented your change and updated the documentation in one commit. 

That commit should have triggered the build pipeline for the *my-quarkus-app* component through the event trigger. Switch back to *RHDH Dashboard* tab in your browser and select the *CI* tab from the top menu.

image::My_First_Commit.png[]

'''

==== CI tab

The CI tab enables you to track the progress of the build pipeline for the my_quarkus_app component. Notice how security measures are baked into the build pipeline, adhering to the policies set by the security team. These measures include:

. CI-based artifact cryptographic signing,
. SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) generation,
. Integration with ACS (Advanced Cluster Security) for image scanning.

As a developer, you don't need to worry about these complex aspects. They are all prepared for you through the Golden Path approach, ensuring a streamlined and secure development process. In fact, we could even replace Tekton with another CI tool, and you wouldn’t need to be concerned with the details!

Once the build pipeline execution is complete, let's review the status of our application. Switch to the Topology tab.

image::CI_Tab.png[]

'''

==== Check application status

In the topology view, you will now see that our Pod is surrounded by a healthy blue ring, indicating that the Pod is running successfully. To open the application, click on the small icon located at the top right of the Pod. Your application will open in a new browser tab.

image::Topology_Tab_Pod_Running.png[]

Test the change you implemented by clicking on the 'hello' link; you should see the API return “Hello from RHDH” as expected.

image::My_Qurkus_App_Running.png[]

Next, switch to the Overview tab. Here, you will notice that the application is synced and showing a healthy status in ArgoCD.

image::ArgoCD_Healthy_Status.png[]

Then, move to the Image Registry tab. The Registry should now be populated with images. Click on the *Scan Results* for the image tagged as *latest* to teview it's scan results. 


image::Scanned_Image_In_Quay.png[]

This section will display all the vulnerabilities identified for this image, providing crucial security insights.

image::Scan_Results.png[]

Finally, switch to the Docs tab. Here, you can verify that the documentation has been updated with the changes you made earlier.
