== RHDH Landing Page Harbor Tour 

=== Login to Red Hat Developer Hub (RHDH)

Click on the Red Hat Developer Hub (RHDH) link provided on the workshop home page. Authenticating to RHDH  involves four quick steps:

. The link:https://www.keycloak.org/[Keycloak] plugin operates in the background to authenticate you. Our *Platform Engineering* team has set up *Keycloak* to use *GitLab* as the identity provider. Once you are prompted to authenticate, click on the GitLab button at the bottom of the screen.

=== A tour of the RHDH Landing Page

The Landing Page of the Red Hat Developer Hub is your gateway to essential information and tools. Here, the Platform Engineering team has conveniently pinned key resources for quick access. This includes a variety of tools and platforms such as developer tools, CI/CD tools, OpenShift Clusters, as well as monitoring and security tools. Let's embark on a guided tour of the capabilities offered through the Landineg Page.

==== Search

In the Landing Page, the first capabiltiy you'll notice in the left menu is the 'Search' function. This powerful tool offers a centralized search capability, enabling developers to swiftly locate the specific information they need. Whether it's items in the Software Catalog, Documentation, APIs, or other resources, this function streamlines the search process. It effectively eliminates the often time-consuming and inefficient task of sifting through various sources or relying on colleagues for information. By simplifying access to essential data, the Red Hat Developer Hub's search function allows developers to concentrate more effectively on their core tasks, enhancing productivity and focus.

==== Catalog

The Catalog serves as a centralized directory, listing all services, libraries, and documentation in a single, accessible location. It enables developers to effortlessly discover and comprehend the available resources, including their current status and ownership details.


=== DOCs

In traditional setups, documentation often resides in separate systems, detached from the codebase. This disjointed approach requires developers to update two distinct systems whenever changes are made to a component, leading to inefficiencies and potential inconsistencies.

Instead, RHDH embraces the concept of 'documentation-as-code'. In this model, documentation is stored right alongside the code, but in a separate directory. This means that as a developer, you can seamlessly create new features, modify your code, update your documentation, and commit all these changes to your repository in a single, unified action.
