== A Day in the Life of a Developer

=== Navigating the Maze

Imagine you've just joined a new organization as a developer, excited and eager to make your mark. Your enthusiasm, however, is quickly dampened by the reality of disjointed systems and scattered information. You're assigned to update a service, but locating the relevant repository and documentation becomes a time-consuming challenge due to poor organization and outdated references.
Setting up your local development environment doesn't fare much better, with fragmented instructions that don't match the current technology stack. Slack messages with conflicting guidance add to the confusion, leading to a slow and frustrating start.

By the end of the day, you've managed a meager commit, your initial excitement replaced with a sense of frustration. This isn't the developer experience you signed up for. It's clear that without a unified system to streamline these processes, your talents are underutilized, bogged down by the very infrastructure that's supposed to support your work.

=== Charting the Course with Internal Developer Portals

The unified system we longed for in the first section is known in tech parlance as an Internal Developer Portal (IDP). IDPs play a pivotal role in modern development environments by offering developers a centtralized interface for accessing the organization's technology stack, including services,websites, data pipelines, and more. By centralizing these resources, IDPs eliminate the need for developers to search for information or traverse a labyrinth of disconnected systems, addressing many of the challenges highlighted in the introduction.

A well-implemented Internal Development Platform approach offers “opinionated and supported” routes called Golden Paths for developers to create software components. In his blog Designing Golden Paths, Raffaele Spazzoli explains that the general notion behind this concept is that the platform offers some form of pre-architected and supported approaches to building and deploying a particular piece of software. If a team can “stay” in the path, then they get a supported road to production without having to learn all the details of the technology used to create that road.
